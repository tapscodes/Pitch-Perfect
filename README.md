# Pitch-Perfect
This is my Pitch Perfect Xcode Project for my Udacity.com course of intro to app development(swift).
## Functions
This application allows you to record an audio file, then change the pitch and play the new audio file via 6 buttons. 
## Assets
100% of the assets in this application come from Udacity.com as does most of the code.
